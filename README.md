## 👋 Welcome, I’m @MarcoTamb
- 👀 I’m interested in Statistics, Data Science and Mathematics. 
- 👨🏻‍💻 I can code in Python, R, Julia, MATLAB and C++. 
- 📌 See pinned projects on my profile for some code samples written by me
- ❓ If you want to look at just one, check out the [Phlegrean-Fields](https://github.com/MarcoTamb/Phlegrean-Fields) repository, a small data visualization project I did in my free time
- 🤫 What I code at work is more interesting, but cannot be shared for many self-evident reasons
